# Fitness-Goals
## Introduction
This fitness goals project is meant to allow me to understand my workout patterns and how to achieve my fitness goals presently and in the future. The fitness data was acquired from my Apple fitness app from August 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023.
I have multiple metrics tracked in the fitness data but my analysis and goals are focused on the following metrics:
1. Active energy
2. Heart rate
3. Duration of workouts
4. Step count
5. Amount of workouts
6. Workout start time
